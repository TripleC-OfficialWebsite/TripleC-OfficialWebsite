The list includes long commutes, expensive parking passes, near-impossible-to-find parking, and the insane rates of current rideshare services. WeRide is a carpool application that seeks to make commuting to campus cheaper, safer, and more convenient. For the drivers, the system will match them with riders on their way to school, they will be paid by the application for the calculated gas money and other small costs. For riders, the system will show them the brief profile of student drivers for them to select on the route to school. The cost will be much lower than uber/lyft and faster than waiting for shuttles/trains.",

Users can select their reading proficiency level, and Defit will translate the vocabularies that are hard to understand or beyond their comprehension level through its algorithm’s own predictions. Defit uses text overlay design to show definitions of unknown vocabularies directly on top of the words. As a result, a smooth reading experience that promotes vocabulary learning is guaranteed. Users can thus read without any interruption or relocation.",
